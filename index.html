				<h2>Master the Gears of History</h2>
				<p>
				<strong>Timeless Empire</strong> is a turn-based strategy game where history is your playground. 
				Developed by a passionate team of five, this experience invites players aged 16+ to lead a 
				civilization through the ages—from ancient ruins to the modern era.

				<h2>The Experience</h2>
				<p>
				Built using <strong>Pygame</strong>, the game challenges five players to compete on a dynamic, 
				ever-changing map. Success isn't just about military might; it requires careful resource 
				management of wood, stone, and gold, and the wisdom to form—or break—alliances.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Dynamic Maps:</strong> Conquer shifting territories with unique terrain.</li>
					<li><strong>Trade & Risk:</strong> Send caravans to allies, but beware of interceptions.</li>
					<li><strong>The Chaos Factor:</strong> Random event cards (plagues, disasters, or boons) ensure no two games are the same.</li>
					<li><strong>Secret Diplomacy:</strong> Use our unique messenger system for private negotiations and tactical betrayals.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Strategy with a Soul</h2>
				<p>
				Beyond the gameplay, <em>Timeless Empire</em> is a work of <strong>satire</strong>. We wanted to 
				explore the absurdity and tragedy of human conflict. By highlighting how history repeats itself 
				through greed and power struggles, we hope to encourage critical thinking about peace and 
				diplomacy in our own world.
				</p>

			<section id="development">
				<h2>Current Status</h2>
				<p>
				We are currently in the <strong>prototype phase</strong>. The core mechanics—including the 
				social chat, resource systems, and turn logic—are fully functional. We are now working on 
				integrating immersive music, voice-overs, and balancing the technologies of each era.
