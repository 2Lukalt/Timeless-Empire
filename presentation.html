				<h2>Master the Gears of History</h2>
				<p>
				<strong>Timeless Empire</strong> is a turn-based strategy game where history is your playground. 
				Experience a massive <strong>1v1v1v1v1</strong> conquest where five civilizations clash for supremacy.
				From the dawn of Antiquity to the distant Future, your choices will define the fate of the world.

				<h2>The Experience</h2>
				<p>
				Built using <strong>Pygame</strong>, the game challenges five players to compete on a dynamic, 
				ever-changing map. Success requires careful management of resources like Gold, Metal, Wood, and Food,
				and the wisdom to form or break alliances.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>5 Distinct Eras:</strong> Evolve from Antiquity, through the Middle Ages, Modern Times, and Contemporary Era, into the Future.</li>
					<li><strong>Strategic Economy:</strong> Utilize Mines, Sawmills, and Caravans to fuel your empire.</li>
					<li><strong>The Chaos Factor:</strong> Random event cards (diseases, disasters) ensure no two games are the same.</li>
					<li><strong>Secret Diplomacy:</strong> Send Messengers across the map to negotiate, but beware, they can be intercepted by enemies!</li>
					<li><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> Defeat is not the end. Continue to interact and influence the game even after your empire falls.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Current Status</h2>
				<p>
				We are currently in the <strong>prototype phase</strong>. The core mechanics including the 
				tech tree, resource systems, and turn logic are fully functional. We are actively refining the 
				balance between military conquest and economic expansion.
